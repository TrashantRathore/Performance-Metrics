# Performance-Metrics
Points regarding this Code
1. This Notebook contains 4 tasks 
2. This Code is related to a Assignment done by Author of this repository.
3. First task is related to 5_a.csv in which [+ve data points >> -ve data_points] 
4. Second task is related to 5_b.csv in which [-ve data points >> +ve data_points] 
5. In both of those task we need to carry out CONFUSION MATRIX, F1 SCORE, AUC( also find tpr, fpr with different thresholds) and lastly ACCURACY SCORE
6. Third task is related to 5_c.csv in which we find the best threshold for a metric A which should be the least in value.
7. Fourth task is related to 5_d.csv in which we compute MSE(MEAN SQUARED ERROR), MAPE(MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR), R**2 ERROR.
8. In all of the tasks only numpy and pandas are used for importing/numerical computation.
9. All the results are printed at the end of each cell block.
10. If you are forging this code please mention this as a reference.
